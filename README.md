# Todo App Assignment

For this assignment you will be writing a Todo App. However, due to the prevalence of basic Todo App tutorials on the internet, this assignment is going to go farther than a basic todo app.

**The app must be in vanilla Javascript. No frameworks or libraries. (ie. React, Vue, Jquery)**

I have bootstrapped the basic structure of a starting app for you in `./src`.

- Your Todo App must fulfill the following user stories:
- As a user, I would like to view todos from the data base (provided data object)
- As a user, I need to view todos by category
- As a user, I need to add todos
- As a user, I need to complete todos (cross off)
- As a user, I need to show/hide done todos (toggle done todos)
- As a user, I need to delete completed todos
- As a user, I need to add categories
- As a user, I need to reload the page and have the todos persist (local storage)
- As a user, I would like the app be well designed

In the `./src/main.js` file you are given an initial data array to mock data from a database. Use this data for your initial app state.

Lastly, you will need to host this project on the internet using a tool like Netlify.
